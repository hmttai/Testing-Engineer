## Personal Work

### Domain Testing
One of the primary tasks within personal work is domain testing. Domain testing involves examining specific aspects of the software's functionality to ensure it aligns with the intended domain or industry. In this project, we focus on domain testing for the OrangeHRM website.

### Automation Testing on OrangeHRM Website
Automation testing is another key personal responsibility. This entails creating automated test scripts and harnesses to assess the functionality and performance of the OrangeHRM website. Automation testing helps increase efficiency and accuracy in the testing process.

## Group Work

### Case Study
The group work component of this project involves conducting a comprehensive case study on the OrangeHRM website. The case study covers multiple testing aspects, including:

- Test Plan: A detailed plan outlining the testing strategy and scope.
- Domain Testing: Assessing the software's alignment with its specific domain.
- Automation Testing: Implementing automated tests to streamline the testing process.
- GUI Testing: Verifying the software's graphical user interface.
- Performance Testing: Assessing the system's performance under various loads.

### Seminar
As part of the group work, we are conducting a seminar. The seminar includes the following components:

- PDF Report: A comprehensive report that explores JMeter tools for performance testing.
- PowerPoint Slides: Presentation slides for the seminar.
- Video Demos: A collection of video demonstrations to illustrate various testing aspects.

Please explore the specific directories and files within this repository for more detailed information on each aspect of the project.

Thank you for your interest in the Testing Engineer project.

# SQL PROJECT: Data Cleaning & Exploratory Data Analysis (Handling raw data by MySQL)
### Using Tech layoffs dataset from COVID 2019 to present.
One of the primary tasks within personal work is domain testing. Domain testing involves examining specific aspects of the software's functionality to ensure it aligns with the intended domain or industry. In this project, we focus on domain testing for the OrangeHRM website.
### Handling duplicates and standardizing data. Looking at null values and removing any columns and rows that are not necessary.
Automation testing is another key personal responsibility. This entails creating automated test scripts and harnesses to assess the functionality and performance of the OrangeHRM website. Automation testing helps increase efficiency and accuracy in the testing process.
### Exploring the data and find trends or patterns or anything interesting like outliers.
